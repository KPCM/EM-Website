### History

The Korean Presbyterian Church of Minnesota (KPCM) is a member of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. (PCUSA).

&#x20;<span style="color: #999999;">May of 1978</span> The Korean Presbyterian Church of Twin Cities was established.

&#x20;<span style="color: #999999;">January of 1991</span> The Korean Presbyterian Church of Twin Cities united with the Korean First Presbyterian Church of MN and formed the KPCM.

&#x20;<span style="color: #999999;">October 20th, 1991</span> The newly merged church moved to its current location. At around the same time, the Senior Pastor of the KPCM hired a pastor for the EM and began to form the English Ministry of our church.

Currently, the English Ministry is led by Reverend Mark Lee.

### Rev. Mark J. Lee

Pastor Mark Lee assumed our English Ministry in July, 2010. He received his M. Div. from Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, PA in 1998. He grew up in Horsham, PA, and speaks both English and Korean. He has ministered in North Carolina; Long Island, NY; and Daly City, CA. Pastor Mark along with his wife Minah, daughter Karis, and sons Michael and Matthew, all look forward to a real winter of ice-fishing, reading, sports and fellowship with our church members.
