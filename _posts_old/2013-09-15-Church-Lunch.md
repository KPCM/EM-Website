The English Ministry will be providing lunch for the entire church on Sunday, October 27th. We will be gathering on Saturday, October 26th for preparation fellowship at 2:00pm. Dinner will be served to all the volunteers on that Saturday. Please make plans to come out and help with the preparation and to enjoy the fellowship with other EM members. For more info, please contact Glen Berkland & Lana Park.
