Hello and thanks for visiting our website. We are an English Ministry congregation of [Korean Presbyterian Church of Minnesota (KPCM)](http://kpcm.org). Our congregation is comprised of families (with and without children), young adults and college students.

Christian life is a difficult pathway and everyone that is seeking to walk with our Lord, Jesus Christ, could use all the encouragement and support he/she can receive. Perhaps you are seeking to know who Jesus Christ is and therefore, seeking true hope in your life. Whether you are a struggling believer (all Christians fall into this category) or a seeker of Jesus, I hope the following two verses can bring you encouragement and support.

**Jeremiah 29:11** "For I know the plans I have for you," says the Lord. "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope."

**Proverbs 3:5~6** "Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take."

God has a plan for **you**! I invite you to our church to come and see Godâ€™s amazing plan for your life as you seek to place your trust in the Lord with all of your heart.

In God's Grace,

Pastor Mark J. Lee
